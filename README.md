OpenIntents File Manager Repo Manifest
======================================

This manifest will check out OIFM and the associated projects. You will
need to use repo (installation instructions can be found at the top of
http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html).

Getting all of the projects is achieved by running the following

repo init -u https://github.com/openintents/filemanager-repo-manifest.git
repo sync
